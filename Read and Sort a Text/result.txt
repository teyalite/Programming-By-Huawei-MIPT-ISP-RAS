A bump as big as a young cockerel’s stone;
And, pretty fool, it stinted and said “Ay.”
And she was wean’d,—I never shall forget it,—
And since that time it is eleven years;
And then my husband—God be with his soul! A’was a merry man—took up the child: “Yea,”quoth he, “dost thou fall upon thy face? Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit; Wilt thou not, Jule?” and, by my holidame,
And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly: “Yea,”quoth my husband, “fall’st upon thy face?
Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen. Susan and she—God rest all Christian souls!— Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
For even the day before, she broke her brow:
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood, She could have run and waddled all about;
I never should forget it: “Wilt thou not, Jule?” quoth he;
I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
LADY CAPULET Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
My lord and you were then at Mantua:—
Nay, I do bear a brain:—but, as I said,
NURSE Even or odd, of all days in the year,
NURSE Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh, To think it should leave crying and say “Ay.”
Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen; That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
Shake quoth the dove-house: ’twas no need, I trow, To bid me trudge:
She was too good for me: but, as I said,
Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
The pretty wretch left crying and said “Ay.”
’Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
